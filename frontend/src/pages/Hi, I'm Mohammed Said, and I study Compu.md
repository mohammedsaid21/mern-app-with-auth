Hi, I'm Mohammed Said, and I study Computer Engineering Systems 

My interests are in Front End development, and I love to create beautiful and performant Apps with Good user experiences.
I gained great practical experience and was able to make complete projects from scratch

I hope that I can use these experiences here with you in the company and at the same time I could get more experiences to reach and develop my level as much as possible

The last project I did was a control panel for a doctor that has all the advantages
And I linked it with Back and Lavell and implemented all the CRUD operations, as well as many advantages such as showing the alarm when any process occurs and of course with the authentication process
I also owned two years as Front End Developer

The skills that I mastered in css, and I can also convert any shape using css
I also have strong experience in javascript as well as react.js and next.js

In times other than work and studying, I like to podcast, Summarize the concepts, and Gaming
